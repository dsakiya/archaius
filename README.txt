Archaius
=========

Moodle theme.

Archaius is a moodle theme with javascript's options for developers. It has a new way to show blocks using tabs effects.

Archaius has predefined tab effect to show course's topics. You can deactivate the effect on the setting page if you want.

Archaius uses some css3 features but it is not a problem, because the css3 is simulated with javascript when it is needed.
